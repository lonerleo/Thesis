# PetClinic Vulnerable Application

This folder will contain automation and deployment scripts for running a vulnerable PetClinic application on your EC2 instance, alongside DVWA.

- The app will be hosted on a different port (e.g., 8081) to avoid clashing with DVWA (port 80).
- You will be able to demonstrate two vulnerable apps running at once for your presentation.

## Next Steps
- Add Docker Compose or deployment scripts for PetClinic
- Update the workflow to deploy and scan PetClinic as well

# NOTE: This is a test change to trigger the PetClinic workflow and verify end-to-end automation.
# PetClinic should be deployed on port 8081, verified, and scanned by ZAP as per the workflow.

# Test comment to trigger PetClinic full scan workflow on push.
