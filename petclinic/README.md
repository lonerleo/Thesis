# PetClinic Vulnerable Application

This folder will contain automation and deployment scripts for running a vulnerable PetClinic application on your EC2 instance, alongside DVWA.

- The app will be hosted on a different port (e.g., 8081) to avoid clashing with DVWA (port 80).
- You will be able to demonstrate two vulnerable apps running at once for your presentation.

## Next Steps
- Add Docker Compose or deployment scripts for PetClinic
- Update the workflow to deploy and scan PetClinic as well
